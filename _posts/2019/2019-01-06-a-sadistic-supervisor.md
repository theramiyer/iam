'I'm doing great!' is what I tell everyone. I strut around the floor, because I'm invincible. I conquer minds using smoke. I don't just affect those who directly interact with me. I affect even those who don't. Everybody knows they resent me. Secretly, everyone wants me. I get things done. Nobody bans me even though on papers I'm shown as though I am a forbidden being. I think it is just because they want to be me. 'Haters gonna hate.' That's another of my favourite things to say.

No, I'm not a cigarette; I'm equally toxic, perhaps more.

Now you know you want to hear an interesting story. I'll give you four.
