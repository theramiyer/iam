'I'm doing great!' is what I tell everyone. I strut around the floor, because I'm invincible. I conquer minds using smoke. I don't just affect those who directly interact with me. I affect even those who don't. Everybody knows they resent me. Secretly, everyone wants me. I get things done. Nobody bans me even though on papers I'm shown as though I am a forbidden being. I think it is just because they want to be me. 'Haters gonna hate.' That's another of my favourite things to say.

No, I'm not a cigarette; I'm equally toxic, perhaps more.

I haven't always been great. I did not have much of a childhood at home. My mother did not like me. Why? I still wonder. I think my elder brother is to blame. He was the "ideal child" everyone wanted in my town. All of my kith and kin would idolise him. He would have all the attention. All the good stuff. He would ace all exams, do well in extracurriculars, even sports. That is all there is to childhood, isn't it? If I had so much as to get my lunch, I would have to go out of my way to grab attention.

First, wailing worked. As I grew up, I figured, it was for kids and girls to be cry babies. Men didn't cry. Better, men made others cry. That sense of total control. You can only experience it. I turned out pretty awesome in college. I had my gang that did not bother being good. Who wanted that, anyway? It was too much work in return for peanuts. And then I had losers like my brother to compete with. Thank you very much. I preferred the pursuit of making others cry. I had a gang. I never listened. I was feared. I was despised.

I fed on it.

And truthfully, it was great. There was almost no day in the four years of my graduation that was uneventful. On most days, we would have our turf wars and petty _panchayat_ to settle, while on the rest, I would be out with girls. Girls love bad boys. They love being dominated. It is some sort of craving for that challenge where they would subtly try to win---but ultimately want to lose; never mind asking. And when real men show their dominance, it gets there oestrogen running. It's a snowball from there.

Oh, have I made them cry. I have lost count. That feeling! There's a zing in your entire body. It almost makes you tremble. You want to grab onto them, and mess with them. Ruthlessly. Like a tiger devours a lamb. All this, without even having to touch them. And then when you touch them. And you kiss the side of their eyes as they unleash a stream of warm salty strength, you realise what you have been missing your entire life. You are almost tempted to let go as the torrent washes your lips. And then the tremors subside as you slowly let go, sure that you've made an impact. A lasting impact. The scar would remain. Forever.

Orgasm? Grow up.

The problem is, most of the world hasn't grown up. They are still stuck with rules, regulations, ethics. Empathy. Ridiculous. But what are you going to do? They have to reach the stage on their own. Not like there's a health drink for this. If only! But you have to live among these imbeciles. These imbeciles run businesses that pay you. These imbeciles are you bosses and subordinates. So you ought to adapt. And I did. Look all benign, yet charming.
