'I'm doing great!' is what I tell everyone. I strut around the floor, because I'm invincible. I conquer minds through smoke. And I don't just affect those who directly interact with me. Everybody knows they resent me. Secretly, everyone wants me. I get things done. Nobody bans me even though on papers I'm shown as though I am forbidden. 'Haters gonna hate.' That's another of my favourite things to say. I know how badly everyone wants to be me.

No, I'm not a cigarette, but I'm equally toxic; perhaps more.

I haven't always been great. I did not have much of a childhood at home. My mother did not like me. Why? I still wonder. I think my elder brother is to blame. He was the "ideal child" everyone wanted in my town. All of my kith and kin would idolise him. He would have all the attention. All the good stuff. He would ace all exams, do well in extracurriculars, even sports. That is all there is to childhood, isn't it? If I had so much as to get my lunch, I would have to go out of my way to grab attention.

First, wailing worked. As I grew up, I figured, it's for kids and girls to be cry babies. Men don't cry. Better, men make others cry. That sense of total control. You can only experience it.

I turned out pretty awesome in college. I had my gang that did not bother being good. Who wanted that, anyway? It was too much work in return for peanuts. To top it off, I had losers like my brother to compete with. Thank you very much. I preferred the pursuit of making others cry. My boys and I never listened. I was feared. I was despised.

I fed on it.

And truthfully, it was great. There was almost no day in those four years that was uneventful. On most days, we would have our turf wars and petty _panchayat_ to settle, while on the rest, I would be out with chicks. Girls love bad boys. They love being dominated. It is some sort of craving for that challenge where they would subtly try to win---but ultimately want to lose; never mind asking. And when real men show their dominance, it gets there oestrogen running. It's a snowball from there.

Oh, have I made them cry. I have lost count. That feeling! The zing in your entire body. It makes you tremble. In excitement, of course. Anticipatio. You want to grab onto them, and mess with them. Ruthlessly. Like a tiger devours a lamb. All this, without even having to touch them. And then when you touch them... And you kiss the side of their eyes as they unleash a stream of their warm salty strength, you realise what you have been missing your entire life. You are almost tempted to let go as the torrent washes your lips. And then the tremors subside as you slowly let go, sure that you've made an impact. A lasting impact. The scar would remain. Forever.

Orgasm? Grow up.

The problem is, most of the world hasn't gotten there. They are still stuck with rules, regulations, ethics. Empathy. Puke. Ridiculous. But what can you really do? They have to reach the stage on their own. Not like there's a health drink for this. If only! You have to live among these imbeciles. These imbeciles run businesses that pay you. These imbeciles are you bosses and subordinates. So you ought to adapt. And I did. Look all benign, yet charming. Always smiling. Composed.

Trust is critical. The more someone trusts you, the more it hurts them when you break it. Sweet, sweet deception. Never let them think that you are a threat. Never let them raise their guards. Be accepted. Be welcome. Enter. Explode. That is how you shatter them. Like I did.

I'll admit: I cannot be friends with girls. They're like fresh flowers. Beautiful and all, but a great inconvenience. And not to mention, equally useless. They're here for a purpose. Coming to work is certainly not it. But you can't go around saying these things. Unless you want to get rejected. Branded.
