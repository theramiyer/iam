I take long walks and go on long bicycle rides. I see people and think about how they are different from me. Sometimes, I like to become their voice because some feel they've lost theirs. Sometimes I'm the voice of reason. I fight. I argue. I question. But I also understand. This site is an attempt to put myself in the shoes of these individuals that I have met---these individuals who have made me think.

Secondly, I also intend to keep this site open to those who would like to submit their story to me. Attribution and privacy will be balanced based on what the sender asks for. I hope you enjoy reading these pieces and send my way constructive criticism.
